Welcome to the "Ames Room Illusion" Simulator!

----------------------------------------------

In this program, you will see how the naked eye is prone to fooling the human mind.

When you run the program, you will see what appears to be a room with white walls and a checkered floor. You will also see a light box which appears to grow larger as moves toward the right wall and shrink as it moves back toward the left wall. But objects aren't known to sporadically grow and shrink like this, right?

Feel free to move around!

[W] or [UP-key]: move up
[S] or [DOWN-key]: move down
[A] or [LEFT-key]: move left
[D] or [RIGHT-key]: move right

[Mouse-up]: rotate up
[Mouse-down]: rotate down
[Mouse-left]: rotate left
[Mouse-right]: rotate right

[Forward mouse scroll]: Zoom in
[Backward mouse scroll]: Zoom out

As you move around the sandbox area, you will see that the size of the box is constant and that it is not actually growing and shrinking. The reason being is because the room is not proportionally shaped as the initial scene portrays and goes against this preconceived notion. For example, the floor and ceiling plans, as well as two of the walls, are not square but trapezoidal. Hence, as the box moves along the back wall parallel to the floor, it moves away from the viewing hole in the scene. In other words, the box is not growing larger and shrinking small, but rather it is moving closer to and moving farther from the viewer.

This program was written in C++ using the OpenGL library, along with the GLEW and GLFW shader languages.
